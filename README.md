Scripts_tests
=============

A little app made for testing php scripts

Usage
=============

This file is used to test multiple PHP scripts and compare the execution time for each execution.
It's really useful to see the difference of two same actions using different functions, such as the difference between strpos() and preg_match(), and many others.

The file is all built-in with jquery and bootstrap's css for you just have one file to include !
